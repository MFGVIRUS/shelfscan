# ShelfScan
_A cross-platform command-line tool (Windows, Linux, macOS) for scanning a media library and reporting on Plex naming compliance._

## üìö Overview

ShelfScan scans a folder (either locally or on a network) and generates a detailed report indicating how compliant the files are with Plex's naming conventions. It identifies issues with file names, folder structures, and multi-episode formatting for both movies and TV shows. Support for music is not yet implemented.

ShelfScan does not modify or rename any files. It's purpose is solely inspection and reporting of file/folder naming issues.

>[!CAUTION]
>- **This is a very early beta release.** There may be mistakes in the filename validation.
>- **File name checks are very strict**. Issues identified by ShelfScan does not necessarily mean there is a problem with it within Plex.

### Linux/macOS users

- Download the appropriate binary for your platform (see table above).
- Install the [.NET 8.0 runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not install the SDK, ASP.NET Core Runtime, or Desktop Runtime.
- Make the downloaded file executable: `chmod +x ShelfScan-x.x.x-<your-platform>`

### Docker users

- Install the [.NET 8.0 runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website) inside the container or use a [.NET container image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/docker/introduction#net-images).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not install the SDK, ASP.NET Core Runtime, or Desktop Runtime.
- Use the `ShelfScan-x.x.x-linux-x64` binary inside the container.
- Mount your media folders into the container with appropriate read access.

### Platform testing notes

* Tested extensively: Windows 11  
* Tested moderately: Linux (64-bit ARM, Raspberry Pi 5 only)  
* Not tested: Windows 10, Linux (x64), Linux (32-bit ARM), Docker, macOS (x64 & Apple Silicon)

>[!NOTE]
>Docker and macOS environments have not been tested, and no platform-specific guidance is available as these setups are outside the developer‚Äôs experience. While ShelfScan should work fine on them, support will be limited to questions directly related to the tool itself.

## üíª Command line options

ShelfScan is a command-line tool. Run it from a terminal or command prompt, supplying all options and arguments directly on the command line.

```
ShelfScan <folder> [movie|tv]
```

If you wish to save the output to a file then append `> [filename]` - for example:

```
Shelfscan d:\movies > report.txt
```

Command line arguments:

- **`<folder>`**   
  Mandatory. Specifies the folder containing media content. Make sure that you provide the same top-level directory as you have configured in Plex.

- **`[movie|tv]`**   
  Optional. By default, ShelfScan will attempt to automatically detect the content type. If it gets it wrong then you can override this by supplying either `movie` or `tv`.

## üõü Questions/problems?

Please raise an issue at https://github.com/mrsilver76/shelfscan/issues.

## üí° Future development

As this is an early beta, the goal is to get movie and TV show validation as accurate as possible.

Afterwards, music libraries may be considered.
